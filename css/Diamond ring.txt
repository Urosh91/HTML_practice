As you can see the ring is quite similar to ones that are already up for mirroring, with exception of this one having T1 iir instead of WED (or mana leech). It is meant for builds that concentrate on pure physical damage and that have no use of WED ( mana leech is quite easy to come by these days). I am aware it has T4 lightning resistance, but I guess losing some resistance wouldn't be that bad for some people, in order to get iir instead of WED on their rings. 

Stats on a ring are: T1 flat phys, T1 life, T1 accuracy,
                     T1 iir, T2 cold res, T4 lighting res

For now mirror fee would be a modest price of 10ex in order to see will people be willing to settle with t4 res, and with every mirror service it will go up for 5ex, up to maximum of 50ex.

For more information or for mirror service you can leave a message on this thread or contact me in game.
